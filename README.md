# FuzzyFraction
(WIP) Fuzzy, Fast Rational number in java.

In this number system, epsilon is the smallest between zero and one and epsilon becomes one at the largest numbers.
For the moment, practically, I'm making no gurentees about epsilon at all for the moment.
This is within spec because numbers are only described with upper and lower bounds.
For now all shifting is done in one shift, while for better epsilons it should probably be done one bit at a time
